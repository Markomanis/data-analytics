Web Based Data Analytics Software using Django and Pandas

This Python project involves building a web application for data analytics and visualization. The app reads data from a CSV file, processes it using Django and Pandas, and generates visual charts for data representation. Key steps in the project include understanding the software requirements specification document, setting up the development environment, installing Django, and learning the basics of Django. The app allows users to submit a CSV file, which is then converted into a pandas data frame for data manipulation and analysis. The resulting data is displayed in tabular format on an HTML page and visualized using ChartJS. The project showcases the integration of Django, Pandas, and ChartJS to create a functioning web application for data analytics and visualization.
